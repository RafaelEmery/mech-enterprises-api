If you want to run the API in your own computer, you'll just need to:

```
git clone https://github.com/RafaelEmery/mech-enterprises-api.git 

npm install

npm start
```

## :question: How it works?

You can *create, read, update and delete* three entities:

- The companies that contains the units
- The many units of the companies
- All the machines from a unit
